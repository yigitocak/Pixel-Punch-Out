## Data

**Pixel Punch-Out** will utilize a relational database structure with the following key entities:

- **User:** Stores information about players, including username, password (hashed), email, and game statistics like wins and losses.
- **Room:** Represents a game session, containing room ID, room name, arena selected.

#### Relationships:
- A **User** can create multiple **Rooms** and join many **Rooms**.
- Each **Room** hosts multiple **Users** and relates to one **Match** at a time.
- **Characters** are selected by **Users** in the **Rooms** for each game session.

This structure supports efficient data retrieval and updates necessary for real-time gameplay and user management.

## Auth

**Pixel Punch-Out** implements a secure token-based authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This system ensures that all user interactions with the game are authenticated and authorized appropriately.

- **User Authentication:** Users must log in to access their profiles and join or create game rooms. Upon successful login, a JWT is generated and sent to the user. This token must be included in the header of all authenticated requests to verify the user's identity.
- **Session Management:** The JWT contains the user's ID and an expiration time, ensuring sessions are secure and temporary. The token automatically expires after a set duration, requiring re-authentication.
- **Security Measures:** Passwords are hashed before storage in the database to protect user privacy and security.


## Roadmap

The development of **Pixel Punch-Out** is organized into an intense 2-week sprint focusing on delivering a playable game first, followed by backend functionalities:


### Week 1: Core Game Development
- **Goals:**
    - Set up the project repository and configure the tech stack.
    - Develop the core game mechanics.
    - Implement character and arena selection functionalities.
    - Start front-end UI development for game.

### Week 2: Backend Integration and Launch
- **Goals:**
    - Implement backend functionalities using Node.js and Express, including room management and user authentication.
    - Integrate real-time communication capabilities with Socket.IO.
    - Finalize the UI integration with the backend.
    - Conduct rapid testing across different scenarios and perform debugging.
    - Deploy the project for public access and perform last-minute optimizations.


**Note:** The focus will be on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that allows for basic playability and user interaction. Additional features and refinements may be planned for future updates based on initial user feedback and project evaluation.

**Nice to have:** Lives section, character selection, and character abilities.
